# NON-REDUNDANT TIER 1 CONTIGS SDIMOS (MANUAL CLUSTER) #
#######################################################

# NOT PERFORMED ON COMMAND LINE: “Manual” clustering.
# Representative sequences were chosen based on the protein alignment and tree made in Step 13.1 (SDIMOs from non-redundant Tier 1 contigs). 
# For each clade, the most abundant sequence with no gap in the first di-iron center (i.e., no missing DE*RH motif in the protein alignment) was used as the representative sequence.

# Copy chosen Tier 1 representative protein sequences from /home/romejess/may2022_metagenomics/ALL-P90-L125-Q60/ALL-P90-L125-Q60.faa into a new file (can use “nano” to create new file): ALL-P90-L125-Q60-test-clust-3.faa

# Make a directory for chosen Tier 1 representative protein sequences
mkdir /home/romejess/may2022_metagenomics/ALL-P90-L125-Q60-test-clust

# Move chosen Tier 1 representative protein sequences to directory
mv ALL-P90-L125-Q60-test-clust-3.faa /home/romejess/may2022_metagenomics/ALL-P90-L125-Q60-test-clust
